#fmiJSCourse

Pong for two (learning project for a university course)

The only purpose of this project was to learn some new stuff, as a first JS project.
The project is for a university course on JavaScript.

As it is for learning there are some things that are not really needed but are there couse I tried them out.

For server I'm using node.js with express, there is mongodb as storage, for real-time communication I'm using socket.io and for visualisation I'm using p5.js Inspired by CodingRainbow.
